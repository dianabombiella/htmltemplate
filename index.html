									<span class="date">About Me</span>
									<h2><a href="#">Hello World</a></h2>
									<h2><a href="#">Be You, Do You, For You</a></h2> 
									<br>
									<span class="">I always look forward to a company that hires remotely. Currently located in Miami, FL 
									 and really enjoying the year round warm weather. Born in NY and moved to Florida over 10+ years ago. 
									 Fluent speaker in English and Spanish. Turning to Spanglish in my conversations is common so don't be surprised. 
									 Decided to pursue UI/UX Design to learn innovative ways to approach service in a more creative and integrated method.</span>
						
									 <span class="">UI/UX design principles of Don Norman emphasizes "Visibility". How Users should know, just by looking at an interface, what 
								         their options are and how to access them. Normanâ€™s idea is that devices, computers, and interfaces should function accurately, 
									 be intuitive and easy to use.</span>
									 <br>
									 <span class="">Undecided career and plethora of things I like to do on my own time. Such as binge on snacks and catching up on National Geographic and making sure I 
									 drink enough water throughout the day. Quantities vary each day and never the same. I am definitely heterosexual and well rounded in
								         divergent nature, animals, and humans.... <- note: words nature, animals, and humans is not chronologically set.</span>
									 <br>	
									 <span class="">In December of 2019 I developed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, I am in overall good health and fully vacinated. So what is benign
					                                 paroxysmal positional vertigo? It happens when small crystals of calcium get loose in the inner ear. It's mostly felt when your getting out of
								         bed, or your tilting your head up. Anxiety and Stress catalyse the minor discomforts that led me to a further curiosity of pharmaceuticals and 
								         alternative natural remedies from Mother Nature. As much as I would like to consider furthering my studies in chemical or behaviorial addictions because
								         the world in fact has an excess of fallbacks and lacks. I decide to focus more on two areas that call my attention the most, design and 
								         usability.</span>
